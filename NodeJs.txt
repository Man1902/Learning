- Node Js is a runtime enviroment for executing Javascript code outside the browser. Writte in C++.
- It is built on Chrome's Javascript V8 engine and it is used for creating backend services (API) on server side.
- It provides 
- Great for real time services (like chats, live update).
- It works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls. 
- Drawbacks of mutlithread model : 1) for every request,server creates a seprate thread(which are limited in number based on resources) 2) if thread acquires 
 an exclusive lock in the shared resource,it will block other threads
- Node.js is event driven,handling all request asynchronously from single thread.Almost not function in Node directly perofrom opertations, so the process never  blocks.
  User Request -> Event Emitters -> Event Queue -> Event loop (Single threaded) -> Thread Pool(FileSystem,Network,Process,Other) -> Databases
- Features : 
1) Even driven non-blocking (Asynchronous) : When req is made,instead of waiting for req to complete,server continues to process other requests.when req 
   processing completes,the response is sent to caller using callback mechanisam.
2) Very fast : Due to goolge's V8 engine
3) Single threaded but highly scalable : 
4) No Buffering : never buffer any data.simply output the data in chunk.
- node global objects and function  : console, setTimeout() , clearTimeout() , setInterval() , clearInterval()
- In Node, every file is a module.variables and functions defined inside file are scoped to that module. They are note available outside module.
- Implicit module wrapper function : 
  (function (exports, requires, module, __filename, __dirname) {
		// module code
  })
  
- Node built in Modules : 
1) os : 
- Provides information about the operation system . 
   var os = require('os');
   var totalMemory = os.totalmem() , freeMemory = os.freemem(); 
2) fs :
- To handle the file system.
   
1) NPM : 
2) Globals : 
3) File System : 
4) Callbacks
