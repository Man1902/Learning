- Cloud Computing is a way for delivering services or resources on-demand.
- Cloud Characteristics : 
1) Elasticity : 
2) On-denamd : 
3) Provided pooled computing resources 
4) Metered service usages : 
5) Broad network access : 
- Advantages of Cloud : Scalability, Collaboration, Security, Cost effective, Availability
- Cloud computing is enabled through these key factors. Cloud Datacenters, Virtualization, Cloud APIs, Cloud storage
- Virtualization Types : Hardware Virtualization, Software Virtualization, Storage Virtualization, Desktop Virtualization
- Cloud Service Models : 
1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) (host): Combination of Physical server hardware,Physical storage, Networking components,Power,Cooling, Physical security
- In this model, Cloud provider owns the physical infrastructure, and offers it to you to host platform and the applications that run on it. 
- With IaaS, you are purchasing use of raw infrastructure. e.g AWS EC2
2) PaaS (Platform as a Service) (build): Layer on top of phyhsical infrastructure,which provides virtualization of OS layer.No control ovet the underlying 
 architecture inclding OS, storage, servers etc.The cloud provider gives the ability to the customer to deploy customer created apps using programming language,
 tools etc that are provided by the Cloud provider. e.g AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- With PaaS, you are purchasing use of say a Unix or a window host in virtual enviroment where in cloud provider manages installation of OS and hypervisor.
3) SaaS (Software as a Service) (consume) : to layer of the overall cloud infrastructure, which offer complete applications to the cloud user.
- In SaaS model, cloud provider, provides access annd maintainance to the application, and you as a customer can make use of it.
- Cloud deployment model : 
1) Public Cloud : 
2) Private Cloud : 
3) Hybrid Cloud : 
4) Community Cloud :

Google cloud platform
-------------------------------
- Cloud computing is the use of remote servers on the internet to store,manage and process data rather than a local server or your personal computer.
- Cloud providers : AWS, Google clopd platform, Microsoft Azure etc
- Google cloud platform is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that goolge uses internally for its end users products such
  as Google serach and Youtube.
- Domains  : 
1) Compute : Compute Engine, App Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions
2) Storage : Datastore, Storage, Bigtable, SQL, Spanner
3) Networking : VPC Network, Network Services, Interconnect
-  Compute Engine : Row server.After choosing OS and desired configuration, We need to install necessary software to use it as per or requirement.eg as 
   an application server.
- App Engine : Extention of Compute Engine.Generally used for web server configration.We don't have to install required software manually.
- Cloud Functions : Same as App Engine  but you do not host an application. Used for backend processing.
- Kubernetes Engine : To deploy application which is running inside container on cloud.
- Datastore : to store NoSQL (unstructured) kind of data.
- Bigtable : to store NoSQL (unstructured) kind of data.Used with hadoop (Bigdata application).
- Storage : File System storage service. Can be used to store application file in storage service.
- SQL :  to store structured data. SQL can not be scaled horizonally.
- Spanner : same as SQL but  it can be scaled horizonally.
- VPC Network : Virtual private cloud. To create an network where two application deployed on cloud can talk with each other.
- Network Services : Load balancing, Cloud DNS, Cloud CDN
- Interconnect : 
- GCP Resources : 1) Zonal : VM instaces, VM discs etc 2) Regional : Static IP address 3) Global : Network,Disk images,Snapshots,Networks 
1) Compute Engine : IaaS 
- Scalable, high-performance virtual machines.
- Google compute engine delivers virtual machines running in google's inovative data centers and world wide fiber network.
2) App Engine : PaaS
- A flexible zero ops platform.
3) Container(Kubernetes) Engine : PaaS
- Deploy,manage and scale containerized applications
4) Cloud Functions : SaaS
- A serverless environment to build and connect cloud services.
